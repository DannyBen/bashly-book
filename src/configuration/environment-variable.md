# Environment Variable

Specify environment variables (required or optional) used by your script.

==- :icon-code-review: Show Me How
```yaml bashly.yml
environment_variables:
  - name: config_path
    help: Location of the config file
    default: ~/config.ini
  - name: api_key
    help: Your API key
    required: true
  - name: app_env
    help: Application environment
    allowed: [dev, prod, test]
    default: dev
```
===

If an environment variable is defined as required (false by default), the
execution of the script will be halted with a friendly error if it is not set.

In addition, you can specify a default value for the environment variable, which
will be used in case the user has not defined it in their environment.

!!! Note
Most properties are optional, unless specified otherwise.
