# Testing Your Scripts

## Static Code Analysis

The bash scripts generated by bashly are
[shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck#readme) compliant, and
[shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) compliant.

This means that you can use these tools to ensure that any custom code you
use in your script, is also valid.

Note that when testing with `shfmt`, you should specify an indentation of 2
spaces, and case indentation rules:

```
$ shfmt --diff --case-indent --indent 2 yourscript
```

## Approval Testing

!!!success Tip
Run `bashly add test` to add a `test` folder to your project, with the 
Approvals.bash framework.
!!!

In cases where your scripts are more elaborate, or when you wish to ensure
your scripts behave as expected, you can use any bash testing framework to test
your scripts.

One such lightweight framework, is
[Approvals.bash](https://github.com/dannyben/approvals.bash#readme), which lets
you test any command in your script, and prompting you for interactive approval
of its output. Whenever the output changes, you will be prompted again to approve it.

A sample test script looks like this:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
source approvals.bash

approve "your-cli --help"
approve "your-cli command --arg"
# ... more tests
```
