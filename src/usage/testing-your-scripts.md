# Testing Your Scripts

The bash scripts generated by bashly are
[shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck#readme) compliant.

This means that you can use shellcheck to ensure that any custom code you
use in your script, is also valid.

## Approval Testing

In cases where your scripts are more elaborate, or when you wish to ensure
your scripts behave as expected, you can use any bash testing framework to test
your scripts.

One such lightweight framework, is
[Approvals.bash](https://github.com/dannyben/approvals.bash#readme), which lets
you test any command in your script, and prompting you for interactive approval
of its output. Whenever the output changes, you will be prompted again to approve it.

A sample test script looks like this:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
source approvals.bash

approve "your-cli --help"
approve "your-cli command --arg"
# ... more tests
```
