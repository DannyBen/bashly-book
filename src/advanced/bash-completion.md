# Bash Completion

Bashly comes with built-in bash completions generator, provided by the
[completely][completely] gem.

By running `bashly add completions` commands, you can add this functionality
to your script in one of three ways:


==- `bashly add completions`
Creates a function in your `./src/lib` directory that echoes a completion
script. You can then call this function from any command (for example `yourcli
completions`) and your users will be able to install the completions by running
`eval "$(yourcli completions)"`.

==- `bashly add completions_script`
Creates a standalone completions script that can be sourced or copied to the
system's bash completions directory.

==- `bashly add completions_yaml`
Creates the raw data YAML file. This is intended mainly for development
purposes.

===

The bash completions generation is **completely automatic**, but you will have
to regenerate the completion function whenever you make changes to your
`bashly.yml` file. 

!!!success Tip
By running `bashly generate --upgrade`, your completions function 
(generated with `bashly add completions`) will be regenerated.
!!!

## Custom command completions

In addition to the automatic suggestion of subcommands and flags, you can
instruct bashly to also suggest files, directories, users, git branches and
more. To do this, add another option in your `bashly.yml` on the command you
wish to alter:

```yaml bashly.yml
commands:
- name: upload
  help: Upload a file
  completions:
  - <directory>
  - <user>
  - $(git branch 2> /dev/null)

```

## Custom flag completions

The `completions` option is also available on flags that have an `arg`.
Similarly to the `allowed` option for arguments, the allowed list is added
to the suggestions automatically (without the need to use `completions`).

```yaml bashly.yml
commands:
- name: login
  help: Login to SETI
  flags:
  - long: --user
    arg: username
    completions:
    - <user>
  - long: --protocol
    arg: protocol
    allowed:
      - ssh
      - telnet
```

- Anything between `<...>` will be added using the `compgen -A action` flag.
- Anything else, will be appended to the `compgen -W` flag.

!!! Note
In case you are using the
[Argument `allowed` option](../configuration/argument.md#allowed) or 
the [Flag argument `allowed` option](../configuration/flag.md#allowed),
these will be automatically added to the completions list as well.
!!!

## Completions in ZSH

If you are using Oh-My-Zsh, bash completions should already be enabled,
otherwise, you should enable completion by adding this to your `~/.zshrc`
(if is it not already there):

```bash
# Load completion functions
autoload -Uz +X compinit && compinit
autoload -Uz +X bashcompinit && bashcompinit
```

After adding this (and restarting your session), you should be able to source
any bash completion script in zsh.
